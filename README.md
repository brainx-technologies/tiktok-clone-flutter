# Project Name
Tiktok Clone

## Description
The Tiktok Clone project aims to replicate the core functionality of the TikTok app. The following features are implemented:

- Displaying content for the "Following" and "For You" sections of the "Home" screen
- Supporting two types of content: Flashcards and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
- Showing the user name, user icon, and content description for each piece of content
- Enabling infinite scrolling to browse through content, similar to TikTok's interface
- Implementing a countdown timer at the top left corner to track the user's time spent in the app

## Assessment Completion Time
It took me approximately 7 hours to complete this project, including the time spent on setup, understanding the requirements, making the video, and completing all the necessary tasks.
